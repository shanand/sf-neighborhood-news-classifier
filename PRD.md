## Executive Summary

The SF Neighborhood News Classifier is an AI-powered system that automatically categorizes San Francisco news articles by neighborhood using natural language processing. This tool enables journalists, researchers, and community organizations to analyze local news coverage patterns and understand neighborhood-specific reporting trends.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Manual Classification Time-Intensive**: Manually tagging thousands of news articles by neighborhood is labor-intensive and subjective
2. **Inconsistent Tagging**: Different people may classify the same article differently
3. **Scale Limitations**: Processing large datasets (4,000+ articles) manually is impractical
4. **Analysis Barriers**: Without neighborhood tags, it's difficult to analyze coverage patterns and identify underrepresented areas

### Impact
- Journalists cannot easily track neighborhood coverage balance
- Researchers lack neighborhood-level news analysis capabilities
- Community organizations struggle to identify coverage gaps
- Audience engagement opportunities are missed due to poor content organization

## Solution Overview

### Vision
Create an automated, AI-powered system that accurately classifies San Francisco news articles by neighborhood with high confidence and detailed rationale.

### Key Value Propositions
1. **Automated Processing**: Process thousands of articles in hours vs. weeks
2. **Consistent Classification**: AI provides consistent, objective neighborhood assignments
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Each classification includes reliability metrics
4. **Transparent Rationale**: Clear explanations for each classification decision
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Handle growing datasets efficiently
